# DC Motor Simulation on Matlab/Simulink

This simulation emulates a Servo drive system where the speed error directly controls the power electronic converter (Four-Quadrant DC-DC). The system is simulated using Simulink in continuous time. The Simulation involves the following key parts:

* Permanent Magnet DC Motor (PMDC)
* Internal Model PID Controller 
* Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)
* Four Quadrant DC-DC Power Converter
* MOSFET Switches
