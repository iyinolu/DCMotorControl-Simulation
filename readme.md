# DC Motor Simulation on Matlab/Simulink

A servo system where the speed error directly controls the power electronic converter (Four-Quadrant DC-DC) is simulated on the Simulink platform. The Simulation involves the following:

* Permanent Magnet DC Motor (PMDC)
* Internal Model PID Controller 
* Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)
* Four Quadrant DC-DC Power Converter
* MOSFET Switches
